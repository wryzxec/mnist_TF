# Classifying Hand-Written Digits

## MNIST

The MNIST database of handwritten digits contains 60,000 training examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each image is 28 x 28 pixels and is stored in binary form.


## Neural Network

The Neural Network consists of 3 layers:

| Layer no.       | Activation Function | Neuron Count    |
|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 1               | ReLU                | 40              |
| 2               | ReLU                | 20              |
| 3               | Linear              | 10              |

## Results

The Neural Network averages ~95% accuracy on the Test Data.
